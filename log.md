# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Thursday, January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began working on a Rails Online Shop.  Did schema, wrote user stories, and achieved MVP (basic CRUD functions for items).

**Thoughts**: I had a great day today!  This challenge is actually a group challenge that I was assigned when I did my coding bootcamp, and at the time I felt like I was really struggling.  I'm re doing the challenge solo this time because I think it's a great challenge to get back into the game.  Felt comfortable with everything I did today, which I'm sure will change soon enough once I try and implement more features.  Didn't time myself, but definitely put in at least 5+ hours today!  Day 1 rocked.

### Day 2: Fridya, January 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began writing tests for my application.

**Thoughts**: I tried implementing tests today and that did not go as well as I thought it would go.  As a result, a lot of my time today was research and looking for good examples and guides online.  I was only able to write one passing test.. BUT I did learn a few things!  Had to update one of my fixtures because I made a minor mistake yesterday, and my test initially wouldn't run because of that.  Also learned about where certain tests should go.  I feel pretty meh about today because there wasn't a whole lot of new code added to my project, but I feel like I just chipped a little at something big so I'm still feeling positive!
